## 1. About this game
This is a game where you run a ramen shop. Players start by launching their store and setting up the store and menu. You can set up multiple items on the menu. The goal is to run the ramen shop for a set period and compete to see who can earn the most profit.

In developing this game, we introduced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Additionally, we created an enjoyable GUI using JavaFX. The cute images of the ramen shop were sourced from [Irasutoya](https://www.irasutoya.com/).
